## 📌 Introduction

I'm embarking on a journey to develop a state-of-the-art Point Of Sale (POS) system designed to ensure seamless transactions across various operating systems. The vision is to offer an uninterrupted experience for users, regardless of their device or network conditions.

- **Universal Compatibility**: Crafted for all major OS frameworks to guarantee a smooth experience on any device.
- **Intelligent Synchronization**: Ensures data consistency between the local storage and the central database, even when transitioning between online and offline modes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter for creating a consistent and engaging UI across iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop.
- **Backend**: Java for its robustness, ensuring a smooth and efficient backend processing.
